## GET /healthz

Returns build metadata so uptime monitors and load balancers can assess service health without authentication.

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Auth | Not required |
| Headers | `Accept: application/json` |
| Response type | `200 OK` with `Health` object |

```http
GET /healthz HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Accept: application/json
```

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "hopper",
  "version": "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
}
```

- `status` hardcodes to `"ok"` when the controller executes.
- `service` is always `"hopper"`.
- `version` is read from `BuildProperties` (the Gradle build info).
