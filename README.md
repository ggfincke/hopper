## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 or 24
- PostgreSQL
- Gradle (wrapper included)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd hopper

# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run the application (development mode with H2)
./gradlew bootRun
```

### Environment Configuration

**Development**: Uses H2 database with default settings

**Production**: Requires these environment variables:
```bash
export DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/hopper
export DATABASE_USERNAME=hopper_user
export DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_db_password
export JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_minimum_256_bits
export CREDENTIAL_MASTER_KEY=your_32_plus_character_encryption_key
```

## Development

```bash
./gradlew build       # Build project
./gradlew bootRun     # Run application
./gradlew test        # Run tests
./gradlew check       # Run all verification tasks
```

## Configuration

The application uses profile-based configuration:
- `application.properties` - Base configuration
- `application-dev.properties` - Development (H2 database)
- `application-prod.properties` - Production (PostgreSQL)

**Key configuration areas:**
- Database connections and JPA settings
- JWT token expiration and security settings
- Credential encryption parameters
- CORS and security policies
